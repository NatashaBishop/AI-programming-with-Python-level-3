Linear regression https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression#:~:text=Linear%20regression%20is%20a%20statistical,we%20have%20the%20following%20dataset: 
Activation Function is used to make to input non-linear to avoid linear output because most real time problems/splutions are non-linear
2 types of problem solution output:
 2 output layers or more - classification problem is assigning a class (cat, dog or chicken) 

 regression - one solution?

 activation Function: relu. sigmoid, ...?

 what .shape does?
 add bias/biases ?
