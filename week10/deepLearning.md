Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks, called deep neural networks to learn from data. * 
The way artificial neural networks work is mimicking the way the human brain works. Artificial neural networks can solve a wide variety of problems, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, analytics and prediction, handling massive data collections.  
The main difference between deep learning and machine learning is the structure of the underlying neural network architecture. Traditional machine learning models use simple neural networks with one or two computational layers. Deep learning models use three or more layers—but typically hundreds or thousands of layers—to train the models. **  
Some of Deep learning applications:   
•	Image recognition: To identify objects and features in images, such as people, animals, places, etc.  
•	Natural language processing: To help understand the meaning of text, such as in customer service chatbots and spam filters.  
•	Finance: To help analyse financial data and make predictions about market trends  
•	Text to image: Convert text into images, such as in the Google Translate app.  


Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.***
