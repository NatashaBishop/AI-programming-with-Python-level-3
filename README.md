https://www.ncclondon.ac.uk/adult-courses/artificial-intelligence-programming-with-python-level-3-certificate/
This course is designed for students who are interested in learning about AI and how to implement AI algorithms and models using Python. Throughout the course, you will learn about the fundamental concepts and principles of AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. You will also learn how to use Python to implement these concepts and apply them to real-world problems.

Key topics:

    an overview of AI and its applications
    ntroduction to Python programming and its key features
    basic data types, control structures, and functions in Python
    working with data using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas
    use of GitHub repositories
    an essential learning of linear Algebra and calculus for Neural Networks 

By the end of the course, you will be able to use Python to develop and implement AI algorithms and models and apply them to solve real-world problems. You will also have a solid foundation in AI concepts and principles and be able to continue exploring and learning more about AI on their own.
