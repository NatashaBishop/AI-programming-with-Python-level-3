You were given the code below .
def dot_product(vector_one, vector_two):
   result= 0
   
   fori inrange(len(vector_one)):
       result+= vector_one[i] * vector_two[i]
 
   returnresult
 
 
Create a Jupyter Notebook python file which:
Create two 2 dimensional matrices
Call the dot_product function and pass the created matrices as arguments.
