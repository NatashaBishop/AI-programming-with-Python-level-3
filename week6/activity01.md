#Boolean Expressions for Conditions 
#Activity01: 

 

#Imagine an air traffic control program that tracks three variables, altitude, speed and propulsion which for a particular airplane have the values specified below:​ 

 

altitude = 10000​ 

speed = 250​ 

Propulsion = "Propeller"​ 

#For each of the following boolean expressions, work out weather it evaluates to True or False and match the correct value. 

 

#Expression 

Altitude < 1000 and speed > 100 #true

(propulsion == “Jet” or propulsion == “Turboprop”) and speed < 300 and altitude > 20000 #false

Not (speed > 400 and propulsion == “Propeller”) #true

(altitude > 500 and speed > 100) or not propulsion == “Propeller” #true
