Activity 2.1.2. 
Activity 2.1.2.  
 
In this activity, we will look at linear combinations of a pair of vectors, v=[21] and .w=[12].  

Instructions.  

Figure 2.1.10. Linear combinations of vectors v and .w.  
a.	ðŸ”—  
The weight d is initially set to 0. Explain what happens as you vary c while keeping .d=0. How is this related to scalar multiplication?  
b.	ðŸ”—  
What is the linear combination of v and w when c=1 and ?d=âˆ’2? You may find this result using the diagram, but you should also verify it by computing the linear combination.  
c.	ðŸ”—  
Describe the vectors that arise when the weight d is set to 1 and c is varied. How is this related to our investigations in the preview activity?  
d.	ðŸ”—  
Can the vector [00] be expressed as a linear combination of v and ?w? If so, what are the weights c and ?d?  
e.	ðŸ”—  
Can the vector [30] be expressed as a linear combination of v and ?w? If so, what are the weights c and ?d?  
f.	ðŸ”—  
Verify the result from the previous part by algebraically finding the weights c and d that form the linear combination .[30].  
g.	ðŸ”—  
Can the vector [1.3âˆ’1.7] be expressed as a linear combination of v and ?w? What about the vector ?[15.27.1]?  
h.	ðŸ”—  
Are there any two-dimensional vectors that cannot be expressed as linear combinations of v and ?
